# Nugget Template
Basic template we use as starting point while coding a resource for [Codigu](https://codigu.co/)

We included [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/) as our mixin library. So you need to install this one first before coding. If youâ€™re not into preprocessors (you should really give it a try!), you can just use the CSS files and delete the SCSS folder.
